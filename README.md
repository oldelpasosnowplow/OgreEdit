# OgreEdit
A ZNES save state editor for OgreBattle March of the Black Queen

This application isn't 100% complete but it was me testing out Prism MVVM with Visual Studio 2016.  I included the packages I used on this application as well.
This will read in a ZNES OrgeBattle save state and allow you to modify items and charactors.  The way OgreBattle was coded it has a limit on characters (64) and Items (255).
It will crash the game and the editor if you go beyond those limits.  Also several pages into the items screen starts to act weird in the game so typically modifying only the 
first two screens of items is recommended.

But I placed this here for all to see and modify.  This was one of my favorite games and it was fun playing around with it.
